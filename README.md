That’s **excellent** — it’s already clean, professional, and readable 👏

Here’s a slightly **refined and formatted version** of your final section (with better visual structure and phrasing that flows naturally in a README):

# YOLOv8n Object Detection Model for the Visually Impaired 🚶‍♀️👁️

Achieved high detection accuracy — correctly identifying most obstacles in real-time with an average precision (**mAP**) of **66%** and smooth guidance at approximately **77 FPS (≈6 ms/frame)**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements and fine-tunes the **Ultralytics YOLOv8n (Nano)** model for efficient, real-time obstacle detection to assist visually impaired navigation.
It delivers an excellent balance between **speed and accuracy**, optimized for deployment on edge devices.

## ☁️ Cloud Training Advantage

This training pipeline is fully **Google Colab–compatible**, enabling seamless execution across different Google accounts.
By leveraging **Google Drive–based checkpoints**, training sessions can be **paused, resumed, or transferred** effortlessly — ensuring:

* 🔁 Continuous training flexibility (even if GPU limits reset)
* ☁️ Persistent data and model storage in the cloud
* 🤝 Easy collaboration and cross-device accessibility

This design makes the workflow **robust, portable, and ideal for research or real-world deployment** scenarios.

Would you like me to add a short **"How to Resume Training in Another Colab"** snippet (like 2–3 lines of code you can paste under that section)? It would show exactly how to continue from your Drive checkpoint — makes it extra practical.
